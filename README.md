## Who am I

My name is Veronika and I am from Ukraine. I was traveling a lot and even lived abroad for two years. I got married last year and started an Instagram page where I'm posting photos from trips with my husband.

## Motivation

The main goal that I set for my final project preparation is to understand how to make a good, beautiful, and informative travel blog with a unique design. I have many pictures in my gallery, all taken by me, and many hiking roads that I would like to share.

On the other hand, my travel blog might be useful for society and travelers.

## Description:

The Project 'VUMGa journey travel blog' is a web application that shows trip details in the form of a blog. VUMG name comes from our first and last names.

There are four different stories from four destinations from
- Austria
- Germany
- Switzerland
- Ukraine
that we have visited for 4 years.

I know that those places in Europe are very popular, but the Ukrainian mountains are a unique destination, which needs more attention.

There is a sticky navigation bar on each page and an arrow that brings the user to the page top. There are buttons that:
- returns a user to the main page,
- gives a user an opportunity to select a page with trip details from a dropdown menu,
- brings a user to a contact page,
- with a link to the Instagram profile.

The main page has links to the page with more photo galleries, and details of trips to Germany and Ukraine.

The first trip to Austria is presented in a photo slideshow gallery with an opportunity to see a full-size image, three other - in the form of articles with links to hiking trail details on external website Strava.com.

## The project consists of the following files:

* application.py,
* a templates folder with 9 HTML files,
* a static folder with 31 images converted for web usage,
* styles.css,
* hp.js.

This Project also has forms.py and contactusMessage.csv files for the realization of the Contact web page and feedback gathering.

The focus of this project was on the styles and manipulations of images.

## Conclusion

During the implementation of the Final Project, I gained extensive knowledge on creating a travel blog web application, as well as experience with Image processing for the Web, CSS, JavaScript, and Flask. The most challenging part of the project was to make a Contact form.

## Possible improvements

I will be growing my Project to motivate people to travel and see the beautiful nature around.
Developing the login form would be a great improvement.
Adding new features as likes or comments, could be useful as well.

## This was CS50.
